Classification Topology Project

Implements a methodology based on local neighborhood graphs (Gabriel graphs)
developed to characterize and visualize the topology of the classification space
(distributions, overlap) and the decision surface.

Code developed as S4 classes provides computation of the local neighborhood graph,
plotting for visualization of the graph, graph ediding for producing condenced
graphs highlighing the decision surface topology, and summary methods for the
graphs.
